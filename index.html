      <p>Anna was born on April 2nd in  Greenville, SC where has spent her entire life in the same house.
        Her parents did not know her gender until she was born, so the surprise of a little baby girl was
        exciting. Anna's dad recalls decorating the house with loads of pink things. She was born a day early
        at <a href=https://bonsecours.com/greenville>St. Francis Hospital</a>, weighing 8 pounds, 4 ounces.
        Anna grew up with her two older brothers Jacob and Joseph. Her favorite foods at that time were mac and
        cheese and chicken strips. Anna recalls trips to Taco Bell with her brothers when her mom and dad were
        at work</p>

    <p>Life in the Wortkoetter household these days is more quiet than usual. Anna is the only child home and
      it gets lonely, although there are perks. Her two brothers are away studying and it's rare to have
      everyone together. She enjoys weekends because she gets to watch football with her dad and weeknights when
      she gets to enjoy making dinner and chatting with her mom.</p>
    <p>Currently Anna is getting used to life in public school. She has a lot more free time to invest into her hobbies.
      She has a strong passion for animals and enjoys her job at a local dog grooming business. She works at the dog
      wash about three days a week. Other days you can find her at the <a href=https://www.greenvillehumane.com/>Humane
      Society</a> where she just loves to hold puppies and walk the dogs. Anna finds time to workout after school too
      because it is a good stress relief. She prefers to go to <a href=https://www.sportsclubsc.com/>Sports Club</a> and
      always tries to go before the rush hour at 6pm. On Friday nights you'll find her at a high school football game.
      When she's not watching the JL Mann Patriots play, she's at Hillcrest where her boyfriend plays linebacker.</p>

    <p>After high school Anna plans to continue school. She is still deciding where she will attend college but she
      really loves <a href=http://www.cofc.edu/>College of Charleston</a>. This College stands out to her in particular
      because her brother lives in <a href=http://www.charlestoncvb.com/>Charleston</a> so that gives her a sense of
      home. Anna plans on majoring in Special Education with a minor in psychology. Anna wants to work alongside schools
      and organizations that assist special needs children and adults. Her biggest dream would be to be a mother one day.
